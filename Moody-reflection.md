* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

_While I understand the meaning and reasoning behind the concepts of git and GitHub workflow, I sometimes forget the order of things and when certain commands should be applied._

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

_It certainly helps to have an extra pair of eyes to catch when things are out of order. I think I have a better understanding of the workflow._

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

_We mostly asked for confirmation of both my peer and I's understanding of concepts._

* What still confuses you about Git?

_How pull/merge request work exactly in regards to local vs remote repos._

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

_There was a bit of added pressure because of the extra presence in the room but it was definitely helpful to have an expert right there to answer questions and confirm understanding._
